<p>
I am currently a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.bbva.es" target="_blank">bbva.es</a> with an IT engineering background, experience in banking and renewable energy industry as well as in research. 
</p>
<p>
My role consists in extracting value from data through innovative in data science and machine learning projects, in order to support business processes and data decision making. In the last years I focused on providing customer and marketing insight, customer segmentation, predictive modeling, reporting with visualization tools and advanced analytics.
</p>
<p>
I am also technology enthusiastic and restless looking for new productive and efficient big data tools as machine learning techniques which improve processes, deal with capacity constraints and give me new opportunities to learn 
Some of the frameworks and tools I usually work with:
</p>
* Python as scripting language with its machine learning, visualization libraries, pandas, numpy, etc. Also R with some additional packages
* Spark, Hive, Impala, Kafka, Elasticsearch, other Big Data/Hadoop/HDF-based tools
* Jupyter, Zeppelin, Kibana, Tableau as BI and visualization frameworks
